### Scrap!

```text
step 1. Get the page
step 2. Make the request
step 3. Extract the jobs.
```

requests import하여 step1, 2 수행



##### CSV란?

Comma Separated Value

각 Col는 ,(콤마)로 구분

각 Row은 new line으로 구분

```text
CSV save mode
open('file.csv', mode='w') 등
mode 가 w일 경우 쓰기모드 -> 쓰기만 되므로 파일을 초기화 후 다시 쓴다.
```









### Data type of Python

```text
Python의 변수 네이밍 규칙은 snake case로 하자
ex) long_name = "name"
```



##### mutable과 immutable

ex) list : mutable, tuple : immutable

```python
python_list = ['a', 'b', 'c']
python_typle = ('a', 'b', 'c')
```

##### Python Modules

docs.python.org에서 Python Module 확인 가능

```python
from math import ceil, fsum
print(ceil(1.2))
print(fsum([1,2,3,4,5,6,7]))
```

Web Scraper 프로젝트를 진행하며, url 모듈, excel sheet 모듈 등을 사용

서로 다른 파일에서의 함수도 가져오기 가능

main.py에서 calculator.py 내 내가 만든 함수 가져오기 가능

```text
어떻게 print() 함수는 인자를 무한으로 받아올 수 있지?
```

"""
Again, the code is broken, you need to create 4 functions.
  - add_to_dict: Add a word to a dict.
  - get_from_dict: Get a word from inside a dict.
  - update_word: Update a word inside of the dict.
  - delete_from_dict: Delete a word from the dict.

All this functions should check for errors, follow the comments to see all cases you need to cover.

There should be NO ERRORS from Python in the console.
